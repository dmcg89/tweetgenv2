'Til I hear an old freight rollin' down the line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I didn't go, I believe I'd blow my stack

I love you baby but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

Some folks might say that I'm no good
That I wouldn't settle down if I could
But when that open road starts to callin' me
There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see

Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand
When the Lord made me, he made a ramblin' man

I love to see the towns a-passin' by
And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
'Cause that's the life I believe he meant for me

And when I'm gone and at my grave you stand
Just say, God's called home your ramblin' man
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Call me a pretty boy
They call me a saint
They call me a sinner
It’s gonna be the same
Now I’m not afraid
And I’m not afear
I ain’t gonna lose it
And I’m not scare
To do the Fearless Boogie
Do the Fearless Boogie
Smokin’ Fearless Boogie
Until it’s gone.

They call me a pontiac
The red in my neck
They call me a cadillac
They call me a wreck
Now I’m not afraid
And I’m not scare
Now I ain’t gonna lose it
No, I’m not afear
And do the Fearless Boogie
Do the Fearless Boogie
Smokin’ Fearless Boogie
Until it’s gone.


They call me a lover
They call me a fool
They call me a winner
They call me a mule
I Do the Fearless Boogie
Do the Fearless Boogie
Smokin’ Fearless Boogie
Until it’s gone.
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee 
We don't take our trips on LSD 
We don't our burn draft cards down on Main Street 
We like living right and being free 

We don't make a party out of loving 
But we like holding hands and pitching wood 
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy 
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do 

Chorus: 
I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee 
A place here even squares can have a ball 
We still wave Old Glory down at the court house 
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all 

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear 
Beads and roman sandals wont be seen 
Football's still the roughest thing on campus 
And the kids here still respect the college dean 
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Lookin' back through the years, I saw my anger
There was things that I could not control
Wanderin' through my memories with my darlin'
Now I fall through the door on my own

On my own again, all alone again
Now I see what it's like when your away
On my own again, all alone again

Now I see what it's like I'm away
He was a man, walkin' big and proud
And he was walkin' through a mighty thick crowd
Although we never could understand where this man had been
For as time grew on, he grew weak and thin

As the days rolled on, through the nights
Well, he started drinkin' so much
He was losin' his mind
And as he sits back, he knows that he'll die alone

On my own again, all alone again
Now I see what it's like when your away
On my own again, all alone again

Now I see what it's like I'm away
Now I see what it's like I'm away
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well, I'm cruisin' all alone
Just a singing my poor song
I've seen them hard hard times
But that's my kind of life

I like it most the time
When I'm drunk and feeling high
Sometimes it gets me down
Makes me feel I'm unwound

And I know it's hard
When you're all alone
And you don't wanna live
And you've got that gun

Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on

Well, I'm cruisin' all alone
Just a singing my poor song
I've seen them hard hard times
But that's my kind of life

I like it most the time
When I'm drunk and feeling high
Sometimes it gets me down
Makes me feel I'm unwound

Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well, I'm a runnin' and gunnin'
A little bit crazy
Got half drunk on the day they made me
I don't know why, I guess it's in my genes

Well, I'm a runnin' and gunnin'
A little bit shady
Got half-stoned on the day they made me
I don't know why, I guess I'm dangerous and mean

(You better)
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, I'm dangerous and mean

Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, I'll drop you to your knees

Well, I'm a runnin' and gunnin'
A little bit shady
Got tattooed on the day they made me
I don't know why, I guess I'm dangerous and mean

Well, I've got my 4-speed, 2-door Chevy
Driving outta hell
Like Satan's gonna catch me
I don't know why, I guess it's in my genes

(You better)
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, I'm dangerous and mean

Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, I'll drop you to your knees

Well, I'm a runnin' and gunnin'
A little bit crazy
Got half-drunk on the day they made me
I don't know why, I guess it's in my genes

Well, I've got my 4-speed, 2-door Chevy
Driving outta hell
Like Satan's gonna catch me
I don't know why, I guess I'm dangerous and mean

(You better)
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, I'm dangerous and mean

Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, oh, you better watch out
Look out, baby, I'll drop you to your knees
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            *Whistling*

Will You be in my heart, we will be torn apart? I don't know.
 
Will you be passing by, when I have a lonely night? I don't know.

Will you be in that bar, waiting for a drinking scar? I don't know.

How Much Time will you have, if you gave us a chance? I don't know.

Will you be in my heart, will you be feeling far? I don't know.

Will you help me along, when I'm closed to nearly gone? 

Can you feel my call, when I'm down that road? I don't know.

Will you be up a par from those honky-tonk scars? I don't know.
 
I don't know if you like my kind of ways, I don't know.

I don't know if you like my worn out boots, I don't know.

I don't know.

Can you help me when I fall, in the morning from alcohol? I don't know.

Can you hear my lonely sound, when I know you're not around? I don't know.

Will you have a heart, when I don't know how to start? I don't know.

Will you help me along when I'm close to nearly gone? I don't know. 

I don't know..

I don't know..

I don't know!

I don't know!

Will you be in my heart, when I fall, waking hard? I don't know.

Can you help my mind, when I'm losing track of time? I don't know. 

When I'm down and out, will you be helping out? I don't know.

When that sun gets cold, will you help me grow old? I don't know.

I don't know if you like my kind of ways, I don't know.

I don't know if you like my frowning face, I don't know.

I don't know..


Will you be standing far, when I've lost all my cards? I don't know.

Can you help me along, when I'm far too gone? I don't know.

When the times get hard, do you want me to cut your yard? I don't know.

Can you help me be strong when those days get too long? I don't know.

I don't know..

I don't know..

I don't know!

I don't know!

Drifting down that lonely lane just ain't the same.

When I feel that empty pain I call your name.

Will you need me when I'm lonely?

Will you need me when I'm lonely?

Will you need with me when I gotta leave?

Will you be with me when I leave?
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the danger that's headin' my way 
Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there hurtin' 
For a lover that don't like my ways 

One day I might be feelin' all right 
When I ain't got these blues 
That's a-hurtin' my mind 
Maybe one day I won't feel cold 
But right now I'm carryin' that heavy load 

Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the danger that's headin' my way 
Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine 

One day I might understand why she don't  
Wanna be with a rebel like me
I don't get it, but maybe I'm not
Supposed to be sittin' there in a lover's tree

Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the danger that's headin' my way 
Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the whiskey, misery and pain 

One day I might be feelin' all right 
When I ain't got these blues 
That's a-hurtin' my mind 
Maybe one day I won't feel cold 
But right now I'm feelin' so damn low

Hurtin' for certain
I've been right there flirtin'
With the danger that's headin' my way
Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there hurtin' 
For a lover that don't like my ways 

Hurtin' for certain 
Hurtin' for certain 

One day I might try to figure out life
When I ain't got this heart of pain
I don't get it, but that's all right 
'Cause I got me another lonely day

Hurtin for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the hard times comin' my way 
Hurtin' for certain 
I've been right there flirtin' 
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine 
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine 
With the whiskey, pills and damn cocaine 

Hurtin' for certain 
Hurtin' for certain

            When the closest one is the farthest away
How it burns in your mind when there's nothin' left to say
When the closest one is the farthest away
Is there anything I can do to help you wanna change
When the closest one is the farthest away
It'll break down your mind with those lonesome feelin' ways
When the closest one has nothin' left to say
Just keep on truckin' through another broken day
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you
When the closest one is the farthest away
How much longer will you take those dark and lonely days
When the closest one is the farthest away
Will there be another chance for us to feel a little change
When the closest one don't look at you the same
Has she forgot the spark that you always used to bring
When the closest one is the farthest away
How it burns in your mind on those tough and lonely days
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you
When the closest one has nothin' left to say
Well, do your best to make her feel wanted every day
When the closest one is hatin' all your ways
Well, let it be and do somethin' to help it go away
When the closest one don't look at you the same
Just try to think about some o' them good lovin' days
When the closest one don't like callin' your name
Remember back when you were once both on the same page
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you
When the closest one is the farthest away
How it burns in your mind when there's nothin' left to say
When the closest one is the farthest away
Ol' time will work against you when you start to fade away
When the closest one is the farthest away
Will there be another chance to try to heal our hurtful ways
When the closest one starts lookin' the other way
How it burns in your mind when she says that you're to blame
All you can do
Is what's best for you
All you can do
Is what's best for you

            From the mountains of Tennessee
To those Minnesota lakes
I hunt and I fish
If I need to get away
If you're findin' faults with me
Moanin' more than I can stand
I tell ya what, for a little while
I'll go see the outdoor plan

'Cause I'll fish when I get hungry
Shoot my guns if I need love
If I wanna breathe a bit better
I'll hit that mountain up above
I'll go huntin' in the mornin'
Once again in the evenin' time
And if I start a-missin' you
I can hit them city lights 

I love to watch all them turkeys
When they strut their stuff
And look at them big ol' beavers
Buildin' their dams in the rough
Those deer's always roamin'
'Cross the land
And if you're lucky, you might even see
A big bear track in the sand

'Cause I'll fish when I get hungry
Shoot my guns when I need love
If I wanna breathe a bit better
I hit that mountain up above
I'll go huntin' in the mornin'
Once again in the evenin' time
If I start a-missin' you
I can hit them city lights

From the mountains of Tennessee
To those Minnesota lakes
I hunt and I fish
If I need to get away
If you're findin' faults with me
Moanin' more than I can stand
I tell ya what, for a little while
I'll go see the outdoor plan

'Cause I'll fish when I get hungry
Shoot my guns if I need love
If I wanna breathe a bit better
I'll hit that mountain up above
I'll go huntin' in the mornin'
Once again in the evenin' time
If I start a-missin' you
I can hit them city lights

            Losin' like a loser
Who's got nothin' to lose
Losin' like a loser
Hell, I don't even feel my blues
But I'll keep on truckin'
'Till I find me somethin' new
I've been thrown down and had it hard
I earned every one of my deep and lonely scars
You can beat me down again only if it helps
What might be left in your cold and lonely heart
When you're losin' like a loser
Who's got nothin' to lose
Some folks might just give it all up
And end up black and blue
But I'll keep on fightin'
While I'm standin' in my boots
Hey, I know how it goes
When everyone's bettin' that you'll lose
I've done my share just like the rest
Drinkin' all of Lucifer's booze
Fallin' for a lady 
Who just wants to make me feel used
It's the kind of life they warned you about
You'll never know until you get through
It ain't no place you wanna be
Unless you like the feelin' of bein' abused
Losin' like a loser
Who's got nothin' to lose
Losin' like a loser
Hell, I don't even feel my blues
But I'll keep on truckin'
I might find somethin' new
I've been thrown down and had it hard
I earned every one of my deep and lonely scars
You can beat me down again only if it helps
What might be left in your cold and lonely heart
When you're losin' like a loser
Who's got nothin' to lose
Some folks might just give it all up
And end up in a noose
But I'll keep on fightin'
Even if I don't have you
Hey, I know how it goes
When everyone's bettin' that you'll lose
Yeah, I'll keep on fightin' hard
As long as I'm standin' in my boots
Hey, I know how it goes
When there's only four walls and you
Hell, I know how it goes
When everyone's bettin' that you'll lose

            Hey, looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good huntin' day

Ya better look out
I tell ya, hold on tight
'Cause the way he's a-runnin'
We'll be at it all night
Hear that ol' barkin'
On that good coon hound
Hell, he ain't gonna stop
'Till he gets what he's found

Hey, looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good huntin' day

I tell ya right now
You better grab your gun
'Cause the way he's-a actin'
Gonna get more than one
He's still runnin' hard
about a half past five
I'm so outta breath
I think I might see the light

Hey, looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good huntin' day

Now he's-a actin'
Like the night's on fire
Hell, he's runnin' so hard
He's bustin' through that bobbed wire
Listen to that howl
On that old black and tan
That's my number one dog
Treein' as hard as he can

Hey, looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
He's the best in the state

Ain't nothin' like the stars
And that bright moonlight
When my dog is treein' hard
On a good huntin' night
Gotta love runnin'
On some Tennessee land
With my number one dog
And my rifle in my hand

Hey, looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good huntin' day

You better grab some Mules
It's gonna be long
I can tell ya right now
The way he's singin' his song
The way he's a-runnin'
Well, he ain't runnin' slow
Hell, we might end up
In bum beep Idaho

Hey, looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good huntin' day

Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
It's a good treein' day
Looky yonder comin'
Runnin' down that mountain
My dog's a-sayin'
He's the best in the state

            I ain't broken down, I'm just broke 
And there's a lot of folks with me in the same boat 
Doin' all we can to have some hope 
We're not broken down, we're just broke 
Fightin' 9 to 5, just tryin' to stay alive 
Seein' good folks die 
When they should have a life 
I ain't broken down, I'm just broke 
And there's a lot of folks with me in the same boat 
Doin' all we can to have some hope 
We ain't broken down, we're just broke 
How many more times will we have to try 
Just to make ends meet 
Makin' sure Uncle Sam is satisfied 
I ain't broken down, I'm just broke 
Sometimes the family farm has to turn to smoke 
I ain't judgin' no one, I ain't no Pope 
We're just doin' what we can to have some hope 
I ain't broken down, I'm just broke 
And there's a lot of folks with me in the same boat 
Doin' all we can to have some hope 
We ain't broken down, we're just broke 
Distant days, you can feel that pain when you might have to run 
Do everything in your power you can do 
To not load that gun 
I ain't broken down, I'm just broke There's a lot of folks with me in the same boat 
We're doin' all we can to stay afloat 
We ain't broken down, we're just broke 
How much longer do they think they can beat us down 
Between you and meThey're tryin' to get us to burn down our own town 
I ain't broken down, I'm just broke 
We're doin' what we can to have some hope We ain't broken down, we're just broke 
Doin' what we can to have some hope 
I ain't broken down, I'm just broke 
We're doin' what we can to have some hope

            Hey boy!

Hell I've been feeling cold as stone
And them long hard days've been movin slow
At least I got my dogs to help me sing my songs
I'm doin what I can tryin to get along

Hey boy

Been tryin to get out of this state of mind
But sometimes you know there just ain't no light
Everybody has them dark and lonely days
Maybe one day soon all of that will change

Hey boy

In that evenin' time when that sun don't shine
I cut a little wood and make me a fire
Some people might put their guns to their head
But I'll tell you right now life is better than dead 

Hey boy

I hate it when I gotta make that dreadful drive
In the city where the things just ain't goin right
At least my sea bee keeps me satisfied 
And listens to the sound of my loud straight pipes

Hey boy

I been feeling coldamine down in Tennessee 
I ain't got no lover whos a wantin me
I take another shot of my misery
To make me feel better than I used to be

Hey boy

Somethin bout drivin my 4 by 4 
Ain't nothin like hearin that motor roar
I love bein jacked up way to high
You know it's cause I'm always full of that rebel pride 

Hey boy

I'm just a skinny man they call me 3 
Now my younger he's a little bit taller than me
I been known to be on the rowdy side
And I'll hit the freight train when it's passin me by

Hey boy

I got me a feelin like I'm cold as stone
Them long hard days've been movin slow
At least I got my dogs to help me sing my song
I'm doin what I can tryin to get along

Hey boy

Been tryna get out of this state of mind
But sometimes you know there just ain't no light
Everybody has them dark and lonely days
Maybe one day soon all of that will change

Hey boy

In that evenin time when that sun don't shine
I cut a little wood and make me a fire
Some people might put their gun to their head
But I'll tell ya right now life is better than dead

Hey boy

Hey boy

Hey boy

Hey boy
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            All you want to do is sit a round and pout
And now I  got enough and so I’m getting out.
I’m leavin’ now...I’m leavin’ now.
I’m a long gone daddy...I don’t need you any how.

Lord , I’ve been in the doghouse so dog gone long
That when I get a kiss ..I think there’s something wrong
I’m leavin’ now...I’m leavin’ now.
I’m a long gone daddy...I don’t need you any how.

I’ll go find a gal that wants to treat me right
You go get youself a man who wants to fight
I’m leavin’ now...I’m leavin’ now.
I’m a long gone daddy...I don’t need you any how.
                
You start up jaws a waggin’ and they never stop.
You never shut your mouth until I blow my top.
I’m leavin’ now...I’m leavin’ now.
I’m a long gone daddy...I don’t need you any how.

I remember back when you were nice and sweet
things have changed...you’d rather fight than eat
I’m leavin’ now...I’m leavin’ now.
I’m a long gone daddy...I don’t need you any how.

I’m gonna do some riding on the midnight train
I’m takin’ everything...except my ball and chain
I’m leavin’ now...I’m leavin’ now.
I’m a long gone daddy...I don’t need you any how.
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            The sun comes up, but I won't go down
I been real high up and I've hit the ground

Memories of the past race through my mind
Just like that train on that old track of life

The sun comes up, but I won't go down
I'm too far gone to start turning around
Well there's no more good times - it's all gone bad
ever since the day I lost the best friend I ever had

The pain began the day she left me
I've made a new friend called misery
So I started drinking to help ease my mind
but it don't seem to keep these tears from my eyes

The sun comes up, but I won't go down
I'm too far gone to start turning around
Well theres no more good times - it's all gone bad
ever since the day I lost the best friend that I ever had

Ever since the day I lost the best friend that I ever had
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Tonight the bottle let me down,
And left your memory come around;
The one true friend I thought I'd found,
Tonight the bottle let me down.

Each night I leave the bar room when it's over,
Not feeling any pain at closing time;
But tonight your memory found me much too sober,
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind.

Tonight the bottle let me down,
And left your memory come around;
The one true friend I thought I'd found,
Tonight the bottle let me down.

I've always had a bottle I could turn to,
And lately I've been turnin' every day;
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to,
And I'm hurtin' in an old familiar ways.

Tonight the bottle let me down,
And left your memory come around;
The one true friend I thought I'd found,
Tonight the bottle let me down.

Tonight the bottle let me down... 
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well, they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
said, "Steve you're way behind time.
This is not Thirty-Eight; this is old Ninety-Seven,
so put her into Spencer on time."

Then he turned and said to his black, greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
and when we cross that White Oak Mountain,
watch old Ninety-Seven roll"

And then the telegram came from Washington station
and this is how it read:
"Oh that brave engineer that ran old Ninety-Seven
is lying in old Danville dead"

'Cause he was going down the grade makin' ninety miles an hour
when the whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck, with his hand on the throttle,
scalded to death by the steam

Now all you ladies you better take warnin'
from this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to a true lovin' husband
he may leave you and never return

            Standin' by, a lonesome graveyard, everything I love is gone, 
Weeping as, they lay my darlin', 
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone... 

In this world, I'm left to wander, with no one to call my own. 
And the one I love is sleepin', 
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone... 

Solo

Skies above, were dark and stormin', for the sunshine all has gone, 
And the one I love is sleepin', 
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone... 

My heart's dead, and yet I'm livin', wanderin' through this world alone, 
I wish that I was with my darlin', 
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone... 
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone...
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well, I was standing on a corner at the flat out in [?] in Nashville, North Caroline
Waiting for a woman that was putting me down and leaving me way behind
And the wind was cold, the wind blew cold.

I walked around the corner to have a cup or coffee
And I met a good buddy instead
we moved across the river for a shot of white lightning that the moose me out of my head
And the wind was cold, the wind blew cold.

I can't forget, that lonesome day
Nothing seemed to go my way
I got put down, by the woman I love
And the wind blew cold lord, lord, the wind blew cold.

Started walking and I thumbed across the Hotspring Mountains there and the Knoxville Tennessee
I hear a freight train, was a-landing before the wind blow
And no one talking to me
And the wind was cold, the wind blew cold

A couple of fellows and a lot truck moving
Took me to the Tennessee line
We got to talking and a-drinking over troubles
On a bottle of home made wine
And the wind was cold, the wind blew cold

I can't forget, that lonesome day
Nothing seemed to go my way
I got put down, by the woman I love
And the wind blew cold lord, lord, the wind blew cold
And the wind blew cold lord, lord, the wind blew cold. 
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            (originally by Waylon Jennings)

A long time forgotten
are dreams that just felt by the way.
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living to day.
But she never complains of
the bad times or bad things he's done Lord.
She's just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come.

She's a good hearted woman
in love with a good timin' man.
And she loves him in spite of his ways
that she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand.
She's just a good hearted woman
in love with her good timin' man.

He likes the night life
the brightlights and his good timin' friends.
When the party's all over
she welcome him back home again.
But she never complains of
the bad times or bad things he's done Lord.
She's just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come.

She's a good hearted woman
in love with a good timin' man.
And she loves him in spite of his ways
that she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand.
She's just a good hearted woman
in love with her good timin' man.

            This ain't Montgomery 
DGA
and it ain't nineteen forty nine. 
It's a very different world and a different time. 

So I'm gonna do things the best way that I know how. 
Cause this ain't Montgomery and I ain't Hank Williams no how. 

People will give you what they think is real good advice. 
Listen to me son and you can make music your life. 

They just don't understand we can't do things like they did back then. 
Cause so much has changed.  It will never be that way again. 

And this ain't Montgomery and it ain't nineteen fifty two. 
And if old Hank were here I bet he'd be a lot different too. 

So I'm gonna do things the best way that I know how.  
Cause this ain't Montgomery and I ain't Hank Williams no how. 

EAB
And this ain't Montgomery and it ain't nineteen fifty three. 
The music is gone now, but it's gonna come back you'll see. 

Hank Williams is dead and he ain't coming back here again. 
I don't know where the music is going, but I know where it's been. 
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Sittin' up all night trying to have a good time
Singing my songs and trying to get paid
I've been roughed up, beat up, I've been cut
I got a tattoo at a tender age
Never could respect a sherriff trying to break my neck
With a few friends and a can of mace
Born on the south-side with a lot of rebel pride
I raised a lot of hell in my younger days

Hey, I can't help what I say
I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it
Well that's the kind of life I'm living
And I plan on living long

Its a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But that's the kind of life I'm living
And I plan on living long

Running hard running free never gonna catch me
Driving too fast on a black top road
Loaded up, hammered back
I'll smack you with my tire jack
You better walk away before I carry you home
Passing my pig sty, sleeping where the dogs lie
Anywhere I go is where I call my home
Been stoned, been straight,
Been to hell and heaven.s gate
I got thrown out 'cause they said I didn't belong

Hey, I just keep movin' on
I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it
Well that's the kind of life I'm living
And I plan on living long

Its a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But that's the kind of life I'm living
And I plan on living long

Hell, that's the kind of life I'm living
And I plan on living long
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well down the Mississippi highway
Into New Orleans
I said everything is going ok

I got my hillbilly ride
And my gal by my side
And we're doing it all the way

We're just a cruising around
From town to town
And we're doing what we like to do

And if you don't like
Our hillbilly sound
Then hey man, go fuck you

I say hey man,
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?

Well I like to get back
By the railroad tracks
And wait for that lonely train

I say hey man,
Can't you hear what I'm trying to say?

We're just some hillbilly jokers
who might be some tokers
and we're doing it all the way

Well I'm a little bit crazy
on the rowdy side
and that's ok with me

Because I smoke my weed
and I drink my wine,
and I'm doing it every day

They just don't understand
we're just having fun
doing it like they used to do

And if you don't like
our hillbilly sound
then hey man, go fuck you

I say hey man,
can't you hear what I'm trying to say?

Well I like to get back
by the railroad tracks
and wait for that lonely train

I say hey man,
can't you hear what I'm trying to say?

We're just some hillbilly jokers
who might be some tokers
and we're doing it all the way

            I'm drunk again
I'm drunk once again
Feeling bad, all alone
Since you left me on my own

I'm drunk again
I'm drunk again
I'm drunk again
I'm drunk again

I had a real good wife
Until she took her life
And she left me all alone
And I don't think I can go on

I'm drunk again
I'm drunk again
I'm drunk again
I'm drunk again

            Well, I'm runnin' down the road about a hundred and five
Don't care if I live, I just wanna die
Searching for a gal who wants to keep me alive
Satan's in the backseat givin' me advice again
Livin' a life of sin

Well, the highways are rocking with our hillbilly sound
Tryin' to show these people how we like to get down
Searching through the crowd for another drunken round
Satan's in the backseat givin' me advice again
Livin' a life of sin
(You're going straight to hell, motherfucker)

Well, the highways are rocking with our hillbilly sound

Livin' a life of sin

Life of sin, life of sin, life of sin, life of sin

            Hey motherfucker
you don't have to tell me
I know that I am not like you
I'm not like you

You don't have a way
I don't have a way
You don't have a sign
I don't have a sign
Hey man, what the fuck is wrong with you?

Ten feet down
in a hole
In the ground
you will go
From my fist

You don't understand
She don't understand
They don't understand
We don't understand about you -
about you

You don't have a way
I don't have a way
You don't have a sign
I don't have a sign
Hey man, don't make me punch you

Ten feet down
in a hole
In the ground
you will go
From my fist

You wanna talk shit now motherfucker?
You wanna talk shit now motherfucker?
You wanna talk shit now motherfucker?
You wanna talk shit now motherfucker?

Take you down
Take you down
Take you down
Take you down

Take you down
Take you down
Take you down

Feel my pain
Feel my pain

It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad

It'll take you out

            You think that you're so tough
Since you have your trust
And I'm gone, gone, gone
And I'm gone

Pistol packin' motherfucker
Pistol packin' motherfucker
Pistol packin' motherfucker

Don't you know how you're in control
Since you have your trust
And I'm gone, gone, gone

You're just a little boy
With a new toy
You're just a little boy

Fight like a real man
Real man, real man, real man

Pistol packin' motherfucker
Pistol packin' motherfucker
Pistol packin' motherfucker

Fight like a real man
Real man, real man, real man
Without a gun

            Well I was driving by myself through Tennessee
and I broke down on the side of the road, look at me

Well I got a mohawk, and that's really sad
that I don't think that they'll think I'm a good man

So I went to a bar, so I could use the phone
The guy just looked at me and said, "Hell no!"

Fuck you, motherfucker!

            Well, I had a good friend
He used to shoot a lot of speed
He was wild and cranky and man
He was always in the need

But he always just had to do it
But he always just had to do it
Now he's lying there fucked up
And he cannot breathe

'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead

Well, I knew a good homey
He used to try to run the streets
He was in a gang and
Had a lot of enemies

But he always never took no shit
He always never took no lip
Now he's lying there fucked up
And he cannot breathe

'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead

Live it up now, live it up now
Live it up now, live it up now
Live it up now, live it up now
Live it up now

Shoot it up
Smoke it up
Smoke it up

'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead
'Cause now he's dead

Now he's dead
Dead
Dead
'Cause now he's dead

            Well I've been high
As the mountains
Cruisin' down the road in my 65
And I've got a
Hard-rockin' band,
Baby that wants to kick it
To the other side

And we're runnin and a-gunnin
And a-jukin' and a-jumpin
And I'm lookin for some lovin'
In another damn town

We like a little country -
We like a little soul -
We like a lotta blues baby
Mixed with the rock and roll

And we're a-runnin and a-gunnin
And a-jukin' and a-jumpin
And I'm lookin for some lovin'
In another damn town

You gotta drink it
You gotta drug it
You gotta drink it
You gotta drug it

You gotta drink it
You gotta drug it
You gotta drink it
You gotta drug it

You wanna jump into the whiskey
you wanna jump into the fire
Living this life in
rock and roll band
it'll make you lose your mind

you gotta eat it-
live it-
breathe it-
suck it-
fuck it-
drug it-
all the damn time

You gotta drink it
You gotta drug it
You gotta drink it
You gotta drug it

Drinkin' drinkin' drinkin' alcohol
Drinkin' drinkin' drinkin' alcohol

Rails and rails and
rails of eight balls
Rails and rails and
rails of eight balls

Drug it drug it drug till I fall
Drink that fuckin' alcohol

            Well, hey there, mister man
What's that you say?
Well, you don't like our style
And you say that we're out of date

With a little bit of Hellbilly country music
A little bit of Hellbilly country music
A little bit of Hellbilly coming your way

I'm a little Hellbilly
I'm a little Hellbilly

Well is raised on a farm
And I drive my truck
And I milk them cows
And I don't give a fuck

Drink my wine
Nine to five
Catch catfish
And I like to fight

I'm a little Hellbilly
I'm a little Hellbilly

Well, I'm doing my time
And I drive my truck
And I don't give a fuck
When I'm stuck in the mud

Drink my beers
Raise my steers
I like country music
And I love Webb Pierce

I'm a little Hellbilly
I'm a little Hellbilly

            I've been all around Gutter Town
Looking for a better frown
Beating on misery's door.

Looking high and looking low
I guess I'm one of those lost souls
Who just don't quite fit in no more.

Drifting, used and feeling down
Staring at another round
Will not that time turn into day.

Taking good times when you're blue
Well there'll be someone there for you
When you're dying on your dying day.

Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you

Racing down that reckless road
Has hard advise that we all know
Take what you can and learn from it.

I once saw a Satanist loose his life
He was rolling the devil with his dice
I guess he was ready to call their quits.

Fighting all night just to keep in line
Trying too hard not to loose my mind
Watching all the folks doing the same.

I've been all around Gutter Town
Looking for a better frown
Why can't no one here remember my name?

Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you

[Instrumental]

I've had hard times trying to beat my wife,
But I never really like the kind of trouble
They got me in along the way.

So I got me a dog and I solved it all
Now me and him are making up our own laws 
There's something about living this kind of way.

Had me a friend in Birmingham
Got a twenty years sentence for a one night stand 
At least he did the time for his son.

I've done it more than once or twice
And I've made it through my darkest nights 
You know I'll always be living on the run.

Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you 
Making it through is what I do to get over you
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            ...keeps me hanging on
The more I run away to keep my mind moving on
It was more in my blood ever since the early days
..take me on the streets of waves
Yeah, I flow away, the adrenaline starts to..
When the lines getting near or hanging down...
We’re not even close to what is called a normal crowd
Yeah, we take... living life and not so loud

Chorus:
We’re waiting for the wave,
No we’re... every single day.
We’re riding the ultimate race
No matter how hard times are
It will all be OK!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Rage and rob ..dropping a huge bomb 
It was down for two months 
But it came back stronger than all!
Hiding .. doing tricks, riding ... 
So the brain moved down
There’s something about this life 
That’s keeping us fall every...
Yeah, we flow the adrenaline starts to ...
..mirror hanging down with the...
No, not even close to what’s called an awful crime
We’re taking... and living life and we’re not slowing down.

Chorus:
We’re waiting for the wave,
No we’re... every single day.
We’re riding the ultimate race
No matter how hard times are
It will all be OK!

Looking all around trying to find me a girl

Chorus:
Sipping on whiskey it will make me say
A couple things that I might regret the next day
Hell, have another drink, it'll be okay,

Sipping on whiskey it will make me say
A couple things that I might regret the next day
Hell,have another drink, it'll be okay,

            The pain felt by two broken hearts, ..wont make two halfs a whole. (or..house a home?)
All the time thats lost when love goes bad, will be time spent alone.
Foolish crying gets in the way, your choices might be bad.
When you find yourself in misery when you lose all you have.
When loves foundation crumbles down, the base for love will die.
And the heart thats broke will build a wall and cause someone to cry.
When bridges burn, the tie is cut and leaves two people sad.
Its not the place you wanna be, when you lose all you had.

When you lose someone that you love so, the pain is on your mind.
You feel so lost and all alone, for the love you left behind.
Sometimes you think about lost love, itll almost drive you mad.
Thats when you know just how it feels when you lose all you had.

So listen to the things i say, ive been there once before, there was once a time i hurt someone thats not here anymore.
Yes i i still hurt and think of her, i made a love go bad.
Oh yes, i know just how it feels when you lose all you had.

When you lose someone that you love do the pain is on your mind.
You feel so lost and all alone for the love you left behind.
Sometimes you think about lost love i'tll almost drive you mad. Thats when you know just how it feels, when you lose all you had.
Thats when you know just how it feels when you lose all you had.

            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            I don't want go home, I'm having too much fun
Looking for things in life that I've never done
I don't want go home, I'm having too much fun
'Cause when I'm home alone, I'm a little bit down

My poor heart broken when you said goodbye
I cried and tried to drink myself till I died
Sleeping alone, there's a thing that's hard to do
When I'm lying here thinking of all the things we used to do

[Chorus:]
And Lord I'm falling further, day by day
The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay
And Lord I'm falling further, day by day
The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay
The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]
And Lord I'm falling further, day by day
The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay
And Lord I'm falling further, day by day
The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay
The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay

The devil's moving in and he's gonna stay
No, oh ohh, no, no, ohh
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Sick in the eyes
Sick in the brain
I'm living to a voice
To kill my pain
Losing your mind
Playing their games
who can drive..... insane

Chorus:
so tired, you're wired
And your lungs are in flame
Just give me one more ...
To ease the blood in my vein

Never look to rain
Or far ahead no more
I’m living day by day.
Most of the time I feel like a whore
all dirty and ashamed well as far back as I can remember
All my heroes had trouble in their heights
Will it might have been drugs or it might been love
But they all knew it was time
To die!

Doing your time,
Making you brave
I’m living to the foolest for the keen of...
The first one in here and last one out
And I’m living every day in ...

Chorus:
So tired you are
And your lungs in flame
Just give me one more ...
To ease the blood in my vein

            Being thrown out at birth
Is my curse luck
And everybody didn't understand
I was being set up.
On the second day i was found
By a bloody bound hound
From a distant day
In hell's lost and found.

Chorus:
From a ghost to a ghost
From a ghost to a ghost
Yeah we know how it goes,
Yeah we know how it goes,
When you're lonely outside
When you're lonely outside
With the ones i know
With the ones i know
From a ghost to a ghost
From a ghost to a ghost
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
Looking for another way
Looking for another way
That we lived before
That we lived before

On the third day i was dead
Torn apart by crows
Found the secrets of the bottle
That no one knows.
Well i've seen it all,
I've done it before
I died long time ago,
In that warn out war!

Chorus:
From a ghost to a ghost
From a ghost to a ghost
Yeah we know how it goes,
Yeah we know how it goes,
Looking for another way
Looking for another way
That we lived before
That we lived before
From a ghost to a ghost
From a ghost to a ghost
Yeah we know how it goes,
Yeah we know how it goes,
Looking for another way
Looking for another way
That we lived before
That we lived before

Watching all that good whiskey
Drowning all my friends
Sailing on this lonely sea
Where no one wins
Built up to be left down
Is in my family tree
See the wolves and the vampires in their misery
Shady eyes and used up words
Dim without a doubt
Wasn't too much time alone
That made you wanna find out

Chorus:
From a ghost to a ghost
From a ghost to a ghost
Yeah we know how it goes,
Yeah we know how it goes,
When you're lonely outside
When you're lonely outside
With the ones i know
With the ones i know
From a ghost to a ghost
From a ghost to a ghost
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
Looking for another way
Looking for another way
That we lived before
That we lived before
From a ghost to a ghost
Yeah we know how it goes,
When you're lonely outside
With the ones you know
Yeah we know how it goes,
When you're lonely outside
With the ones you know

            She's standing high on cloud nine, believing all my lies
I was trying to win her over, and did to my surprise
I don't have all the things I said I could give her
I promised her a moon that I can't deliver

She'll be hurt when she finds I'm a dead dreamin' fool
Although she might forgive, she won't like being used
I offered her life lined with gold and silver
I promised her the moon that I can't deliver

She's too happy to be hurt so I'll starve for a time
I don't know what I've got that makes her eyes shine
But I've got her heart rollin' like and overflowin' river
I've promised her a moon that I can't deliver

She'll be hurt when she finds I'm a dead dreamin' fool
Although she might forgive, she won't like being used
I offered her life lined with gold and silver
I promised her the moon that I can't deliver

Now I'll face reality with what I've got to thrill her
I promised her a moon, and that's what I'm going to give her
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Love at dawn in... gotta ...
Love at dawn in... gotta ...
And the stars are getting darker
And the moon is starting to fade
Laugh is getting harder
While the pain never leave my face!
Stars are getting darker
And the moon is starting to fade
Laugh is getting harder
While the pain never leave my face!

Love at dawn in... gotta be...
Love at dawn in... gotta be ...
Stars are getting darker

            I'll save my tears for when you are gone, dahaa!
I'll save my tears for when you are gone, dahaa!
I'll save my tears for when you are gone, yahhh!
We tried so hard, when times were bad, tryin' ta keep our love strong, yahhh!
Our love was great, but now its gone, i guess i'll have to be movin' on with no ?one? ?(harm)?
I'll save my tears for when your gone you can remember me, big and strong, yahhh!
I'll save my tears for when you are gone, ahaa! Ohhhhohohooo!

            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Gettin' drunk and fallin' down
Has taken its toll on me
I like livin' life full throttle
But now it seems like I'm runnin' outta steam
I'll never give up on havin' fun
And raisin' hell in Tennesse
I like a good time livin' on the run
With my good friend misery

'Cuase gettin' drunk
And fallin' down
I'd say I'm known
All over town
It's the kind of livin'
That's gonna put me in the ground
Gettin' drunk
And fallin' down

Well I did my best to stay
On the good side of the tracks
But my friend Billy Joe's
Done got me drinkin' back outta the paper sack
And now I'm here drinkin' 
All alone at the bar
Buck Owens a-singin'
About his honky-tonk scar

'Cuase gettin' drunk
And fallin' down
I'd say I'm known
All over town
It's the kind of livin'
That's gonna put me in the ground
Gettin' drunk
And fallin' down
Gettin' drunk
And fallin' down

            The bottle's getting lower again my friend
And the hard times are trying its best to win
The bottle's getting lower again my friend
So let's get d*mn loud and show the rebel within

The bottle's getting lower again my friend
So do yourself a shot and let's start to sin
The bottle's getting lower again my friend
Let's light up a smoke and live hard till the end

Yeah I'll do it right you can do it wrong
Just lookout darling cuz you know I'm c*ck strong
You can do me right and I'll do you wrong
Just lookout darling cuz I'm showing you the rebel within

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn, again

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn

The more I try to keep hanging on, it makes me feel like I've lost everything I own
Maybe it was all the hell I raised, or it might have been the whiskey that I drank for days
Was it cuz I don't fit in, or maybe it's was cuZ I had the devil as a friend
Hell I know I never made mama proud, so let's live it up and you can shoot it down, again

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn, again

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, I'm showing you the rebel within

yelled (rebel within rebel within)

The more I try to do right, it just seems wrong
I guess that's the curse of livin' out my songs
Born of bad blood since day number one
Hell I was worse off than a loaded gun
The life I leed has always been fast to me
And I never let the hard times make me weak

The bottle's getting lower again my friend
So let's get d*mn loud and show the rebel within
And I'll do it right you can do it wrong
Just lookout darling cuz you know I'm c*ck strong
You can do me right and I'll do you wrong
Just lookout darling cuz I'm showing you the rebel within

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn, again

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn, again

I'm drunk, again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn, again

I'm drunk again
You're stoned, again
Let's f*ck, again
Till dawn

The rebel within, The rebel within, The rebel within, The rebel within

            Runnin for the mountains
Yeah I got a heavy load thats been hauntin' my day
Fightin' my own demons
Seems like its getting a lot harder these days
But I'm doin' what I can runnin' from my crazy ways
Tattooed and branded, shootin' down fame, don' it my own way
Livin' like and outlaw, lovin' all the pain and the hard times comin' my way
No I'm not losin' myself to the changin' ways of today
Busted and held for ransome
Yeah I've don my time gettin' beat by the man
Drifin' stoned and lonesome
Yeah I know how to get by the best that I can
Yeah I'm lookin' for a mountain to wash my dirty hands
Yeah I'm lookin' for a mountain that I wanna call home
Yeah I'm lookin' for a mountain, a place to rest my bones and I just wanna breath that mountain air til I'm gone 
Runnin' on empty, I been speedin' so hard my eyes are turnin' gray
Feelin' mean and shaky from all the hellraisin' I've done for today
Now I'm headin' down south tryin to find a better way
Yeah I'm lookin' for a mountain that I wanna call home
Yeah I'm lookin' for a mountain a place to rest my bones
Yeah I know I been ridin high and that made mama cry cause I been busted my whole damn life
I been busted my whole damn life
I been busted....yeah I know how to run, I know how to survive cause I been busted my whole damn life.

            Drifting alone just like a dog now
Running with a no place to go
I'm trying to get over something
That did its best to take my soul

(chorus)
You gone but not forgotten 
And i see your smiling face
One day I'll be over you dear
When I'm done living in this place

I've been torn down and thrown outta here
Shaking like a bag of bones
Looking for some piece of mind
Until you let me go

(chorus)

I've played every card I have
Each time I had to fold 
One day I might try to win back
The love from me you've done stole

(chorus)

and I dont know what im gonna do or how im gonna be
yea im puttin it down gonna try to stand on my two feet
so this is the last time the needles going in 
to try to set my soul free

i dont know what im gonna do but somethings gotta change
cause all the Heroin and downers are takin away my flame
ive done had four friends die around me
now i realize that old number 5 just might be me

Once your a junkie they say itll never go away
but at least im gonna try
to make it through one more day
im just now startin to tune into who im suppose to be
so im breakin the chains of the needle 
thats had a hold on me
i dont know what im gonna do 
but somethings gotta change
cause the Heroin and downers are taking away my flame
ive done had four friends die around me
and i realize that old number 5 just might be me
yea i realize that old number 5 just might be me

            My mind is breakin', can you feel the heat?
My boots are burning, when they hit the street

Good morning whiskey
Good morning night
The end of the world is in my sight

Coming out from the other side
If you know me you must have died

-Chorus-
Karmageddon
Karmageddon
Bringing Karmageddon on it's way

The world goes round
Too fast to see
The killing here
Well it gets waist deep

Good morning captain
The scout will say
The end of the world's gonna come today

I reach way back, with an Indian guide
The battle i saw, I must have died

-Chorus-

Karma coming round like a raging flame
I look like Abel, but I'm raising Cain
War and money burning all the time
What's going down is coming round
Karmageddon's bound

-Chorus-

Traveling back, on a spirit ride
It's going down, the captain cried

            I've lost in Oklahoma.
I've been busted and thrown in jail,
And I didn't have no mama to try to pay my bail.

Yeah I know about losing, cause I've lost all I've had,
but I guess that's the price you'd pay when you're on heartbreak's edge.

Down in Arizona, I felt hell on me
And I've lost me some damn good friends
who gave their life to speed.

One day I might find out what is all about,
but until then I'll just drink some more
until I figure it out.

On the run driftin' alone
like a dog without a home
on the run, driftin' alone
doin' time, running on call

I know about losing, cause I've lost all I've had,
and I did my best to make folks think that I was really worse than bad
Being tattoed as trouble helped me out in New Orleans
but the price I had to pay for that was love and misery.

On the run driftin' alone
Like a dog without a home
On the run, driftin' alone
Doin' time, running on call

Doin' time, driftin' alone
Doin' time, running on call

            Well I'm sittin' here drinkin' over mama
Well I just can't believe that she is gone.
But I never did think mama would leave us,
To fend for ourselves on our own.

Well now paw, he can't hardly understand it,
'Cause he never did treat our mama wrong.
But I guess that mama never told him
She started smokin' crack
At the age of sixty one.

And it's been years, since we've seen our mama
Even though I heard some stories about her nights.
And poor LJ, the sheriff, told us,
That mama got killed by her damn crack pipe.

Well I'm gonna have to find paw a good woman,
Cause he's startin' to look just like a bag of bones.
She's gonna have to clean all those shotguns
And skin those critters we bring home.

And it's been years, since we've seen our mama
Even though I heard some stories about her nights.
And poor LJ, the sheriff, told us,
That mama got killed by her damn crack pipe.

Yeah mama got killed by her damn crack pipe.
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well the grand ole opry aint so grand anymore
Did you know Hank Williams aint a member but they keep em outside their door
Hell they didnt even really want Johnny Cash back in 74'
Said the grand ole opry aint so grand anymore

Well they were nervous about Waylon cause he had a crooked smile
For many many years they never wanted Bocephus cause hes too god damn loud
Did you really think they ever wanted Johnny Paycheck hanging around
Hell naw cause their too up tight wild 
For real rebels like to get down

To most people listening to this it might seem like im talking shit
But if you look behind the scenes of whos pulling string well god dammit it'll make ya sick
Hank Williams still aint reinstated and i'll tell ya thats fuckin bullshit
And if king jimmy martin if he was still here he'd tell em all to fuckin suck his dick

Well they were nervous about Waylon cause he had a crooked smile
For many many years they never wanted Bocephus cause hes too god damn loud
Did you really think they ever wanted Johnny Paycheck hanging around
Hell naw cause their too up tight wild 
For real rebels like to get down

And the grand ole opry aint so grand anymore
Well they done fucked off the people that made it when it wasnt shit before
Hell they didnt even really want Johnny Cash back in 74'
Said the grand ole opry aint so grand anymore

Naw the grand ole opry aint so grand anymore
Did you know Hank Williams aint a member but they keep em outside their door
Hell they didnt even really want Johnny Cash back in 74'
Said the grand ole opry aint so grand anymore

You know it makes me wonder folks 
Has the opry sinned?

            livin hard wild free is the life for me and i'm always good friend with bad company
i drink all dayjust to get to feeling right and i'm just trying to get ahead in this wreckless life
working hard and playing when i can raisin hell in the mud and livin off the land
i get tired when i have to walk a straight line, cause the devils pouring drinks and his daughter needs a ride
well it's hard to see that i love you so well it's plain to see that i let you go
living wild and free keeps me on the ground and i'm running like hell to keep from goin down

i been riding all day with me i'm wired??? that's the life i chose it keeps my soul on fire
gettin drunk and playing real loud it's what i do to make the crowd get down
and it's hard to say i'm not much of a family man. cause i play all night and raise hell with my hellbilly band
and  i know i was never quite good enough for you . so i'll sit right here and have another drink or two

yeah it's hard to see that i loved you so. well it's a plain to see that i let you go
livin wild and free keeps me on the ground. and i'm running like hell to keep from goin down
and i'm running like hell to keep from goin down.

            I'm all messed up and drivin around town 
Well my old trick, well she done had to kick my ass out 
Now I'm raisin hell and lookin for a light 
Livin fast and dyin young is the new style of life 

Me and my friends we like livin on the run 
Just because we're wild I guess they don't like where we come from  
Hell we all like to get drunk and fall down all over town 
And you know each damn day that we're livin we're damn right and rebel proud      

Well the wind keeps gettin colder but I never let that hold me back 
I done the best that I could do to keep my life on track 
Now I'm countin out quarters and tryin to buy some beer 
And it's so god damn lonely since you're not here 

Me and my friends we like livin on the run 
Just because we're wild I guess they don't like where we come from  
Hell we all like to get drunk and fall down all over town 
And you know each damn day that we're livin we're damn right and rebel proud 

You know that every damn day that we're livin we're damn right and rebel proud

            well i'm working real hard and not gettin paid i'm sick of this life and i gotta get a break
i've been real high and i've been down low and i live in a shack on a country dirt road
so i'm workin real hard and not getting paid and i'm sick of this life and i gotta get a break
and i just can't get by anymore. i've been real high and i've been down low
and i live in a shack on a country dirt road and my best friend is my magnum fourty four

Well workin' real hard ain't hard to do When you got you a lotta money comin' to you
But I ain't got a dime so I'll just sit here
Even Though I'm Broke I've Got A Six-pack of Beer.

Well I've paid my dues And I've paid my rent  And they still try to take everything they can.
Well I thought I had a good thing going on But the sheriff broke my door and he took me on
And he said hey boy you owe the government.

Well workin' real hard ain't hard to do When you got you a lotta money comin' to you
But I ain't got a dime so I'll just sit here Even Though I'm Broke I've Got A Six-pack of Beer.

So I workin real hard and not gettin' paid And I'm sick of this life and I gotta get a break
And I just cant get by anymore. I've been real high and I've been down low
And I live in a shack on a country dirt road And my best friend is my Magnum forty-four.

            well i wish i knew what i could say or do 
that would give me another chance with you
well i was mean as i could be but i wish that you could see
i never meant for you to end up hating me

yeah i wish i knew, i still had you   that i wish i knew
hell i wish i knew, that we weren't through   i wish i knew

well you dont talk to me no more, ever since you left my door
and its killing me each time i hear that old train roar
well i know you're not at home and i'm still holding on
but every day i'm stuck singing this same old song

yeah i wish i knew, i still had you that, i wish i knew
hell i wish i knew, that we weren't through, i wish i knew
how i wish i knew, that i still had you
how i wish i knew,   that we weren't through

how i wish i knew, that i still had you
how i wish i knew....

My family had some rich folks' but they'd never call
If they wanna be that way well that's fine with me
Cause i ain't got a thing to say to a man filled with greed

Well if you can't even help your own,
Well my friend one day you're gonna be all alone

Well i'm real down to earth,
and i know just how it hurts,
to be in a bind, just tryin to stay alive

Well i can drink and i can cuss And i can be pretty doggone tough
I like to stay up all night just to see that big sun rise,
and light-up my life

You better keep your eyes on whats goin on
With the government today, cause they're doin us wrong
They took the farm away from my poor grandad
And i never will forgive them for doin that

Well if you can't even help your own,
Well my friend one day you're gonna be all alone
Well if you can't even help your own,
Well my friend one day you're gonna be all alone

            Well I'm rollin' down that Texas line to see that bar room gill
If I'm to get fired up and mean and drinkin' time my friends
I know that someone's going down, that's the rumor  I hear on streets
I take that jack and put it on my ass 'cause I'm a redneck fuck from Tennessee

Well I don't give a fuck no more 'cause pa's on trucker speed
I've done me twenty years of ridin' these lines and I definitly got forty in me
I never give in to what I fear, cause I'm dealin' with the devil you see
I'm ridin' this hate train every fuckin mile and I'm never gonna run outta steam

Well damn right you better watch your ass when you're dealing with a rebel like me.
That's right I'm a son of a son of a bitch and that makes me Hank 3
When I'm going down I don't need no one to be there next to me
I'm doing' time on this ol' hate line and I'm never gonna run outta steam

Well I'm rollin' down that Texas line to see that bar room gill
If I'm to get fired up and mean and drinkin' time my friends
Yeah I know  someone's going down, that's the rumor that I hear on streets
I take my jack and put it on my ass 'cause I'm a wild buck from Tennessee
And I take that jack and put it on my ass 'cause I'm a rebel fuck from Tennessee



            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well, I'm all messed up in Dixie
And I’m lookin for a damn good time
Well, all my friends in Dixie
Well they’ve already lost their mind

'Cause I've been drunk for 30 days
and I don't care if I die
and I’m Drugin' fast and hard
and that's the way I spend my time
and I don't need no one tryin' to tell me
how to live my own no-good life
My own hellbilly ride

'Cause it's long, long, long, long hauls
and those close, close, close, close calls
'Cause the Devil is my friend
'Cause the Devil is my friend
'Cause the Devil is my friend
'Cause the Devil is my friend

'Cause I've been drunk for 30 days
and I don't care if I die
and I’m Drugin' fast and hard
and that's the way I spend my time
and I don't need no one tryin' to tell me
how to live my own no-good life
My own hellbilly ride

'Cause it's long, long, long, long hauls
and those close, close, close, close calls
'Cause the Devil is my friend
'Cause the Devil is my friend
'Cause the Devil is my friend
'Cause the Devil is my friend

            Well why does it hurt when i see you again? 
Is is the memories, or Jack Daniels understands? 
And I dont know if I'm out of control. 
Coz lately I've been spinnin', 
and drinkin' alone. 

(chorus) 
Will you pick up the gun dear, and put me asleep? 
Coz' I'm sleepin' on missery and she's cuttin' me real deep. 
And I'm all alone. 
Driftin' and Stoned. 
Bein' too far gone. 
Well I'm stoned and alone. 

Hell I've been surrounded by whores and thieves. 
That was always tryin' to get the best of me. 
And I don't mind getting thrown out on the street. 
Coz I can get by without much to eat.

Drinkin my own blood because I'm above the human kind 
Don't give a fuck and I'm always fuckin mad 
And don't you ever think about puttin me in your god damn rehab 

My blood is like a poison always raping you 
It's gonna make you see a side that you never fuckin knew 
Doin what I'm doin and I'm always fuckin hard 
And now I'm doin dope smokin smoke 
Sometimes I gotta steal me a car 

Cuz I Punch Fight Fuck (Punch Fight Fuck!)

            3 shades of black is where I come from. 
Depression, Missery, and Hellacious fun. 
No we're not the kind to turn our backs and run 
coz 3 shades of black is where we come from. 
We are a certain breed and we dont like you. 
Some are junkies some are freaks and others are everyday ghouls. 
No one will ever know what we've been through 
and we are proud in the light of the moon. 

(Chorus) 
3 shades of black 
3 shades of black 
We all like metal and Whiskey! 
Livin' Hard and chasin' down Hell. 
We'll never give up on what we have because the darkness gives us our thrills. 

Yeaaaaaaaahhhh! Yeeeeeaaaaahyeaaaaaaaah! 

3 shades of black is where I come from. 
I was born in the sacrafice when I was young. 
3 shades of black is what makes us strong, 
and we all wear it like a uniform of chosen ones. 

(Chorus) 
3 shades of black. 
3 shades of black. 
3 shades of black. 
We all like metal and Whiskey! 
Livin' hard and chasin' down Hell. 
We'll never give up on what we have because the darkness gives us our thrills. 

Coz' the darkness gives us our thrills...............

            I woke up this mornin', kissed my wife goodbye 
i pray to god that i'll make it home safe tonight 
it's a dangerous job but i take that risk 
i'll trade my blood and sweat just to feed my kids 
i've been working for the man since a tender age 
now a rich politician wants to lower my wage 
pour me a drink so i can understand 
these are the struggles of a working man 
i work outside in the pouring rain 
when it's cold as ice when i'm full of pain 
it don't matter what i feel inside 
as long as the job i'm working gets done on time 
the boss man says works getting slow 
pack up your tools boys and head on home 
i pour another drink and try to understand 
these are the struggles of a working man 
you see i work construction 
i build things 
do you understand how important that is to the world? 
i don't know if ya'll realize what kind of pressure that puts on a man like me 
i love my wife and i raise my son, best i can, better then some 
i just found out the other day i got another little one that'ts on the way 
i took a new job down at the factory, ya it don't pay much but at least we can eat 
i roll up a smoke and think a new plan? (can't really hear that) 
these are the struggles of a working man 
when down to the river just the other day 
got down on my knees and began to pray 
i said lord please won't you understand 
the struggles of a working man

            Well my worn-out boots are taking me downtown
and I'm looking for trouble and I wanna get loud.

Serve me up a drink and I'll shoot it right down
and I'll jump up on the bar and holler "One more round!"

I'm going straight to hell
Ain't nothing slowin' me down
I'm going straight to hell
so you just better get me one more round!

Well back in the day with my uncle Jed,
he kept a lot of moonshine out in the shed.
He taught me how to drink - how to be real proud
of my hillbilly ways and my outlaw style.

I'm going straight to hell
Ain't nothing stoppin' me now
I'm headin' straight to hell
so you just better get me one more round!

Well I'm racin' these backroads trying to save my life,
'cause the sherriff wants to kill me 'cause I fucked his wife.
Always on the run with a gun in my hand
'cause I like a good time and a one-night stand.

I'm going straight to hell
Ain't nothing slowin' me down
I'm going straight to hell
so you just better get me one more round!

So you just better get me one more round!
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            I been beat up bad, I been kicked around,
I been thrown out of every damn bar in this old town,
In this old town.
I guess you don't like the way we like to have our fun,
'Cause I'm always out there an' I'm on the run,
Yeah, I'm a-runnin' an' a-gunnin' an' a-lookin' for a damn good time.

I done so much trip, I can't look you in the eye,
You know I's tryin' to find that ultimate high,
An' I was hangin' with my good friend, an' his name is David Allan Coe.
(Coe, Coe, Coe.)
Well, I was runnin' real hard an' he was runnin' real fast,
An' we got caught-up, up there on the pass:
And we ended up back at this bar on the side of that road.

I been beat up bad, I been kicked around,
I been thrown out of every damn bar in this old town,
In this old town.
I guess you don't like the way we like to have our fun,
'Cause I'm always out there an' I'm on the run,
An' I'm a-runnin' an' a-gunnin' an' a-lookin' for a damn good time.

-Instrumental Break-

I done so much trip, I can't look you in the eye,
You know I's tryin' to find that ultimate high,
An' I was hangin' out with my friend Mr, er, George Jones.
(Jones, Jones.)
Well, I was messed up bad an' he was messed right,
An' me an' George, well we sat an' talked all night,
About the good times an' how country music's lost it's soul.

I been beat up bad, I been kicked around,
I been thrown out of every damn bar in this old town,
In this old town.
I guess you don't like the way we like to have our fun,
'Cause I'm always out there an' I'm on the run,
An' I'm a-runnin' an' a-gunnin' an' a-lookin' for a damn good time.

            Well you never took my heart,
When I tried hard to give it to you.
And I know you can't be true,
'Cause you just wanna be roamin' free.
Now I'm lookin' straight at you,
An' see you with another man.
So I take the shot of whiskey,
So I don't have no regrets.

Well, I've fallen drunk again:
I guess she must have got to me.
I don't usually let a woman,
Get an upper hand on me.
Now I'm lost an' now I'm broke,
An' now I ain't got nothin' to lose.
But I still sit here an' think about,
The things we used to do.

-Instrumental Break-

Walkin' through the crowded streets,
I don't see no-one carin' for me.
That's all right, I don't need anyone,
Except myself, you see.
Now I'm stronger an' I'm smarter,
An' I'm not like I used to be.
But I still sit here an' think about,
The things you did to me.

Yeah, I still sit here an' think about,
The things you did to me.

            Well, oh what a feeling 
that burns down low
when you ain't got no where to turn, 
or no where to go
It makes me feel like sometimes 
I'm outta control
So I'm gonna get wasted 
with all my country heroes

I'm drinkin' some George Jones, 
and a little bit of Coe
Haggard's easin' my misery 
and Waylon's keepin' me from home
Hank's givin' me those high times - 
Cash is gonna sing it low
I'm here gettin' wasted - 
here with my country heroes

I'm drinkin' that whiskey 
out of that glass
and if that ain't country, 
boy, you can kiss my ass
I wanna hear them old songs - 
nothin' of the new
'cause this might be the last time 
I'm gonna see you

So I'm drinkin' some George Jones,
and a little bit of Coe
Haggard's easin' my misery
and Waylon's keepin' me from home
Hanks givin' me those high times -
Cash is gonna sing it low
and I'm here gettin' wasted -
just like my country heroes

I'm here gettin' wasted -
with all my country heroes

            Way down in West Virginia,
There are some people who are one of a kind.
They don't need nothin' from nobody,
'Cause they're already doin' fine.
You got Hasil Adkins hunchin',
An' Mamie's raisin' hell.
The legend of D Ray White,
Will never die like a rebel yell.

An' ol' Jesco's dancin' in his Daddy's shoes.
Yeah, ol' Hasil's still hunchin' out them 
Boone county blues.
(Boone county blues.)
An' ol' Mamie, you know she's done some time in jail.
The legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell.

-Instrumental break-

Birdie May White, she's the strongest woman,
That I've ever met in my life.
She raised over twenty-four of her own,
An' had to watch her husband die.
She's always fightin' hard,
An' livin' off the land.
When she's done livin' in this world,
You know, the Lord's gonna take her by her hand.

An' ol' Jesco's dancin' in his Daddy's shoes.
Yeah, ol' Hasil's still hunchin' out them 
Boone county blues.
(Boone county blues.)
An' ol' Mamie, you know she's still raisin' hell.

Yeah, the legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell.

            Low down, once again 
Well I'm strugglin' now 
To get by, my friend 

It's keepin' me up 
Real late at night 
I just can't settle down 
My honky tonk life 

Driftin' around 'bout a half past four 
With the blues on my back 
And a bottle on the floor 
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down 
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me Low down 

Low down
Once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
To get by my friend
It's keepin' me up real late at night
Hell I can't settle down my honky tonk life

Driftin' around 'bout half past four 
With the blues on my back 
And a bottle on the floor 
Drinkin' until I think I'm gonna fall down 
'Cause my sweet little baby had to kick me lowdown 

Low Down
Once again
Well I'm strugglin' now
Just to get by my friend

            Well, I've been awake for eight days straight:
Well, it must've been them pills I took.
I been twitchin' an' turnin' an' seein' visions:
It must've been them pills I took.

Well, I don't know if it were an' I don't know   where I got 'em,
But they sure did make me feel good.
They kept my heart from feelin' blue,
An' kept my thoughts away from you.

Well, there's blood on the carpet an' holes in the walls:
Well, it must've been them pills I took.
Yeah, the mirrors are all busted an' someone's cryin':
It must've been them pills I took.

-Instrumental Break-

I've lied an' I've stole an' I ain't fuckin' jokin':
It must've been them pills I took.
Yeah, the mirrors are all busted an' someone's cryin':
It must've been them pills I took.

I still don't know if it were an' I don't know where I got 'em,
But they sure did make me feel good.
They kept my heart from feelin' blue,
An' kept my thoughts away from you.

"Doctor Forrest, dial 118, please."
"He's in a ward."

            Well, I have got no money but I am doin' fine.
I'm just a hillbilly hell-raiser; I'm tryin' to kill my time.
An' I'm lookin' for that gal, about five foot ten.
An' I'm gonna take her down that road of livin' a life of sin.

Because I'm drinkin', druggin': I'm havin' lots of fun.
I always carry round my loaded shotgun.
If I think I'm gonna have a bad time,
I got a little bit of smoke an' a whole lotta wine.

-Instrumental break-

Well, I once had this gal: I thought she'd be my bride.
But then she had to leave my ass for that other guy.

An' now I'm drinkin', druggin': I'm havin' lots of fun.
I always carry round my loaded shotgun.
If I think I'm gonna have a bad time,
I got a little bit of smoke an' a whole lotta wine.

-Instrumental break-

Well, I don't really care if you hate me, you see,
'Cause I'm just a country boy from the state of Tennessee.
A little bit crazy, on the loudish side,
'Cause I like drink my whiskey an' I like to get high.

An' now I'm drinkin', druggin': I'm havin' lots of fun.
I always carry round my loaded shotgun.
If I think I'm gonna have a bad time,
I got a little bit of smoke an' a whole lotta wine.

            She said she's gonna quit me,
If I didn't quit the booze.
So I just started drinkin' more,
To see if she would really choose.
And I have to hand it to that girl:
She meant every breath.
An' I'm glad she did, 'cause I was about,
To drink myself to death.

Because my drinkin' problem left today.
She packed up all her things and walked away.
Well, it looks like off the bottle now is where I'm gonna stay,
Because my drinkin' problem left today.

-Instrumental Break-

Well, she said I had problems:
Boy, was she ever right?
To keep from goin' home to her,
I'd stay out, drunk, all night.
And I believe that woman left me,
In the nick of time.
If she'd a-stayed much longer,
I'd have drinked up my last dime.

Because my drinkin' problem left today.
She packed up all her things and walked away.
And it looks like off the bottle now is where I'm gonna stay,
Because my drinkin' problem left today.

Yeah, it looks like off the bottle now is where I'm gonna stay,
Because my drinkin' problem left today.

            Well, I was rollin' by myself, went down to Memphis, Tennessee
And I was looking for a guy, had a mullet but no teeth
And I was trippin' on some acid a latino gave to me
Yeah, I was smoking morphine til it knocked me off my feet
Then I scored some "H" from my old Uncle Pete
now I'm startin' to feel like I might've ODed

On an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest like I'm on ten
and I love gettin' high - hate bein' low
and I like to drive my truck down a muddy dirt road
and I'm workin' real hard, tryin' to get paid
'cause I'm a crazed country rebel and I'm driftin' state to state

Somehow I made it up to Texas with a carload full of grass
and I'm seeing all these pigs who wanna bust my ass
and I'm always livin' hard - always smokin' weed
now I'm hangin' out in Texas drinkin' mushroom tea
and I'm fucked up on the floor - and I think I know why,
must've been some of that Boone county moonshine

and an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest like I'm on ten
and I love gettin' high - I hate bein' low
and I like to drive my truck down a muddy dirt road
and I'm workin' real hard, tryin' to get paid
'cause I'm a crazed country rebel and I'm driftin' state to state

I had to get up off the floor, tried to get myself in line
'cause the ceiling's talkin' to me, and the pisser's flushin' fire
That's why they call me 'full throttle' - I like a good time
it all started at a bar with a friend of mine
Well she had to hook me up - she said she'd blow my mind
I've been up for four days so cut me out another line

of an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
I'm gonna live it to the fullest like I'm on ten
I love bein' high - hate bein' low
and I like to drive my truck down a muddy dirt road
and I'm workin' real hard, tryin to get paid
'cause I'm a crazed country rebel and I'm driftin state to state

            Well some say I'm not country 
and that's just fine with me
'Cause I don't wanna be country 
with some faggot looking over at me
They say that I'm ill-mannered 
that I'm gonna self-destruct
But if you know what I'm thinkin' 
you'll know that pop country really sucks

So I'm here to put the "dick" in Dixie 
and the "cunt" back in country
'Cause the kind of country I hear now days 
is a bunch of fuckin' shit to me
They say that I'm ill-mannered 
that I'm gonna self-destruct
But if you know what I'm thinkin' 
you'll know that pop country really sucks

Well we're losing all the outlaws 
that had to stand their ground
and they're being replaced by these kids 
from a manufactured town
And they don't have no idea 
about sorrow and woe
'Cause they're all just too damn busy 
kissin' ass on Music Row

So I'm here to put the "dick" in Dixie 
and the "cunt" back in country
'Cause the kind of country I hear nowdays 
is a bunch of fuckin' shit to me
And they say that I'm ill-mannered 
that I'm gonna self-destruct
But if you know what I'm thinkin' 
you'll know that pop country really sucks

And if you know what I'm thinkin'
you'll know that pop country really sucks

            Well, hello there folks, how the hell are you doin':
It's good to be in your local bar again.
So let's get loud, we'll get stoned an' get proud,
Have a damn good time until the show's at an' end.
Sometimes I'm wired an' sometimes, I'm tired,
But I'm doin' the best that I can.
So let's have a drink and a glum with Hank,
An' may the outlaws rise again.

Well I'm a son of a son:
I've got a chip of what I've said an' done.
Well, I remember watchin' ol' Waylon,
When he was shootin' his shotgun.
It's a certain kinda livin',
It's a certain kinda style.
Not everybody likes us,
But we we drive some folks wild.

-Instrumental Break-

Well I think I'd rather eat the barrel,
Of a double-barrel loaded shotgun,
Than to hear that shit they call pop-country music,
On ninety-eight-point-one.
Just so you know, so it's it's set in stone,
Kid Rock don't come from where I come from:
Yeah, it's true, he's a Yank, he ain't no son of Hank:
If you even thought so, god-damn, you're fucking dumb. 

So let's get real loud:
Let's get stoned and proud.
Pour me another shot of whiskey,
An' this one's for the south.
It's a certain kinda livin',
It's a certain kinda style.
Not everybody likes us,
But we we drive some folks wild.
Not everybody likes us,
But we we drive some folks wild.
Not everybody likes us,
But we we drive some folks wild.

            Yeah, I can feel it's time for me to be movin' on.
And the reason I know is for us, the good times have gone.
We keep gettin' further than closer, day by day.
And if you ever need someone to help you, don't ever call my way.

'Cause Lord, I'm fallin' further, day by day.
The devil's movin' in like he's gonna stay.
I tried, my heart, to give her somethin' true.
But when you're lovin' an angel of sin, she'll never be there for you.

-Instrumental break-

My poor heart broke the day you said goodbye:
I cried an' tried to drink myself nearly dry.
Bein' alone is a pain that's hard to .....
When I'm lyin' here thinkin' of all the good times with you.

And Lord, I'm fallin' further, day by day.
The devil's movin' in like he's gonna stay.
Oh, I tried, my heart, to give her somethin' true.
But when you're lovin' an angel of sin, she'll never be there for you.
Yeah, when you're lovin' an angel of sin, she'll never be there for you.

            I got the Louisiana Stripes,
and their always chainin' me down
I'm in debt for 99 years for shootin’ my wife to the ground

Well she had to love my friend,
and that’s not right with me
So I grabbed my gun, shot both in the head and then I threw their ass in the creek

Now I'm doin’ my time, in this Louisiana Pen
Thinkin’ about maybe bein’ free on the day that I'm a dead man

-Instrumental Break-

Well it took some time getting’ used to, 
being locked in this prison cell
But I always hum those tunes of George Jones to help me through my days of hell
I've done me 25 years,
 and that’s alright with me
‘Cause I got me a lot of      damn good friends in this Louisiana penitentiary

Now I'm doin’ my time, in this Louisiana Pen
Thinkin’ about maybe bein’ free on the day I'll be walkin’ to feel 
that fire of the Loui-si-an-a  Pen-i-ten-tia-ry

"At 2:59 AM" 
"This is Houston calling, we just wanted to say Hello, Hello, 
Hi *giggles* Alright goodnight bye"

            Well i'm leavin mississippi 
And im looking for higher ground
Said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

Well i ain't proud of the things i've done
So i've got to change it now
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

I got an 18 wheeler and a worn out dog
And i ain't got nothing to say to the law
I got 10 more miles and i'm hittin' that county line
And i ain't got no more worries on my mind

Well i'm leavin mississippi 
And im looking for higher ground
Said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

Well i ain't proud of the things i've done
So i've got to change it now
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

Well my worn out jeans didn't fit no more
Had long hair on my back
I guess that's not the best 'pearance 
To that judge in black

So he picked up his pen and he put me away 
For a little stretch of time
I said 7 long months 39 days and never did a crime

I got an 18 wheeler and a worn out dog
And i ain't got nothing to say to the law
I got 10 more miles and i'm hittin' that county line
And i ain't got no more worries on my mind

Well i'm leavin mississippi 
And im looking for higher ground
Said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

Well i ain't proud of the things i've done
So i've got to change it now
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around

I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
I said 7 long months 39 days to turn my ways around
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well i'm broke, lovesick, and driftin'
And i've done a lot of hard, hard livin'
Livin' on the road
And seein' how it goes
I grew up fast and it shows
Cause livin' the nightlife
Is where i belong
And drinkin' with the drunks
Who don't want to go home
And it's hard, it's rough
But i can't quite get enough
Oh i'm doin' the best that i can
Well i'm broke, lovesick, and driftin'
And i've had my share of good women
I once had a good home,
A wife to call my own,
But now i'm here drunk and alone
Cause livin' the nightlife
Is where i belong
And drinkin' with the drunks
Who don't want to go home
And it's hard, it's rough
But i can't quite get enough
Oh i'm doin' the best that i can
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well my name is cecil brown 
And i'm from a little town 
And people don't think much of me 
I never understood 
Why they thought i was no good 
But this is how it seems 
The feelings of this worn out cowboy 
Will make you feel so cold 
I've traveled up and down so many 
Kind of lonesome roads 
I once took the high road 
And it took me straight to hell 
And i stood there all by myself 
Cause all alone's where 
I feel like i belong 
Cause it don't matter
Who's right or wrong 
The feelings of this worn out cowboy 
Will make you feel so cold 
I've traveled up and down so many 
Kind of lonesome roads 
Pickin' up the pieces 
Of my broken family 
Is not an easy sight to see 
And as the leaves have changed 
It helps ease the pain 
And sufferin' they left for me 
The feelings of this worn out cowboy 
Will make you feel so cold 
I've traveled up and down so many 
Kind of lonesome roads
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well, we were lovin' and a-huggin' and a-kissin' and a-squeezin'
On a friday an' saturday night

Just a-dancin' and a-prancin' and a lotta romancin' and
Boy, did it sure feel right

But now we're cussin' and a-fussin' and we can't win nuthin'
Ev'ry friday an' saturday night

Now there's no more dancin' for this king of romancin'
'Cause it looks like i've lost the fight

Just a little more lovin' and no more cussin'
Would make me feel alright

How 'bout some lovin' and a-huggin and a little bit of rubbin'
On this cold and lonely night

Because i'm lonesome and i'm jonesing for a little bit of lovin'
And baby, i'm just your type

Now there's no more dancin' for this king of romancin'
And it looks like i've lost the fight

Well now my sweet little baby done got plum crazy
And she's lookin' to start a fight

And she's a-cussin' and a-fussin', talkin' 'bout her cousin
Walkin' around with a forty-five

And she's a tough one and a fun one who can sure give a good one
If you ever get to spend the night

She's a sexy honey-baby that's just plum crazy
With them wild and crazy eyes

Well, we were lovin' and a-huggin' and a-kissin' and a-squeezin'
On a friday an' saturday night

Just a-dancin' and a-prancin' and a lotta romancin' and
Boy, did it sure feel right

But now we're cussin' and a-fussin' and we can't win nuthin'
Ev'ry friday an' saturday night

Now there's no more dancin' for this king of romancin'
And it looks like i've lost the fight
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Ah yodel-ay-heeee he-he-he
Ah yodel-oh-hooo hoo-hoo-hoo
Ah yodel-ay-heeee he-he-he
Well my hat's done worn out
My boots are bad
I ain't got a gun
But i wish i had
And i'm down
In a one horse town
My gal done left me
The other day
Said i didn't bring home
Enough of that pay
And i'm down,
In a one horse town
But i'm doin' fine,
I'm doin' ok
I think i might get by
Just one more day
Well when you get low down
You got nothin' to lose
All you can do
Is start singin' the blues
When you're down,
In a one horse town
I drank on tuesday
Until i fell down
I woke up on wednesday
And you weren't around
And i'm down,
In a one horse town
But i'm doin' fine
I'm doin' ok
I think i might get high
Just one more day
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Sittin' in the bayou country,
Just me and my fishin' line
I raised a lot of hell and i hollered,
Sippin' on that georgia moonshine
Well, i know how to have a damn good time
And i take my shots
Straight out of the jug
And i like to get pure drunk
In that mississippi mud
Well lets throw us a little party baby,
I'll call a few friends of mine
We'll dance all night till the sun comes up
And we'll drink our selves completely blind
Then we'll rock on down the line
And i take my shots
Straight out of the jug
And i like to do a little dance
In that mississippi mud
Well, i was raised by an awful alligator
He taught me how to walk the line
He used to deal cards from the bottom of the deck,
But a tennessee woman took his life
But he sure gave me some damn good advice
And i take my shots
Straight out of the jug
And i like to get pure drunk
In that mississippi mud
And i take my shots
Straight out of the jug
And i like to do a little dance
In that mississippi mud
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            As i watch the sun
Set slowly i hold back the tears
And i can't help but wonder
Why the lord had to put me here
Caused i've raised hell
All night long
And i've seen a good
Man go wrong
And i can't help
The way that i am
Cause the whiskey weed and women
Had the upper hand
Livin' lonely
Is the life that i been livin'
I got drunk
The day my paw went to prison
And when my mama died
I just didn't care about livin'
And i drank myself blind
Just tryin' to find a good reason
And i've raised hell
All night long
And i've seen a good
Man go wrong
And i can't help
The way that i am
Cause the whiskey weed and women
Have the upper hand
Yeah the whiskey weed and women
Have the upper hand,
Hand,
Hand
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            
Now playin' country music
It ain't like it used to be
I'm so tired of this new stuff
They're tryin' to get me to sing
That ain't no country music to me
Well, you can only take so much
Of putting people down
When you got the best,
That's tryin' to beat your back doors down
Well, i used to think that country
Was out of nashville tennessee
But all i see in nashville,
Is a bunch of backstabbers takin' you and me
They don't care about the music ya see
Well, i used to think that country
Was out of nashville, tennessee
I'd rather take my things and
Go back to texas ya see
Now, i would pack up
And i'd leave this dirty town
But they've done taken me for so much
That i can't get out now
Maybe one day but not right now
Well, i used to think that country
Was out of nashville, tennessee
I don't think that country's here
'Cause they killed it ya see
Well, i used to think that country
Was out of nashville, tennessee
I'd rather take my things and
Go back to texas ya see
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well walkin' with sorrow
Through a lonely day
With those empty bottles
Tryin' to ease my pain

I'm still here drinkin'
Over the good ol days
When i had my gal
And everything was ok

[yodeling]

Well walkin' with sorrow
Is a lonely way
With those empty bottles
Tryin' to ease my pain

I'm still here thinkin'
About the good ol days
When i had my gal
And everything was ok

[yodeling]
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Livin alone,
Singin my songs
Thinkin bout the good times
When you were my own

Lady you taught me
How to hurt and cry,
And each day i'm not with you
I die more inside

Honey sweet lady why did you go?
And leave me here dying
All alone in my world?
It's all gone wrong
Since you've been gone

So give me 5 shots of whiskey
To help kill the misery and pain
You put me through
Thanks for the good times,
For they were the best of my life
I spent with you
Now what can i do?

Walkin' on broadway
Not havin a care
I see you and your new guy
Who's strokin' your hair
And i can't keep staying
Here in my hometown,
Got to get on with my life somehow
It's all gone wrong
Since you've been gone

So give me 5 shots of whiskey
To help kill the misery and pain
You put me through
Thanks for the good times,
For they were the best of my life
I spent with you
And i still love you
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well I'm gonna do some drinkin'
I'm gonna drink all that whiskey that I can
Well I'm gonna do some drinkin'
I'm gonna drink all that whiskey that I can
Cause I'm a drinkin', smokin' 
Nighttime Ramblin' kinda man
Well I'm gonna do some smokin'
I'm gonna smoke all that good stuff that I can
Well I'm gonna do some tokin'
I'm gonna smoke all that best stuff 
across this land
Cause I'm a drinkin', smokin' 
Nighttime Ramblin' kinda man
Well I'm gonna do some raisin'
I'm gonna raise all that Hell that I can
Then I'm gonna do some drinkin'
I'm gonna be the loudest man in this Damn Band
Cause I'm a drinkin', smokin'

            I've been up all night and I can't sleep
I've been thinkin' about you and I can't eat

I tried to go outside, but it strarted to rain
and I'm sittin' here in tears callin' your name

Callin' your name O Lord, I need you now
I didn't know how far I was driftin' out

It's been so hard livin' all alone
I need ya this time - Lord, please can ya give me a home

It's been so hard these last few years without you
I've been wild and I didnt have a care
I've caused myself so much sorrow
so I'm callin' this time - can I be saved

Callin' your name O Lord, I need you now
I didn't know how far I was driftin' out

It's been so hard livin' all alone
I need ya this time - Lord, please can ya give me a home

I'm calling this time - Lord, please can ya give me a home
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Well they blew up the chicken man 
In philly last night
Now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' 
Ready for a fight,
Gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble busin' in 
From outta state,
And the d.a. Can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble 
Out on the promenade and the
Gamblin' commission's hangin' 
On by the skin of its teeth
[chorus:]
Well now everything dies, baby that's a fact,
But maybe everything that dies, someday comes back
Put your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in atlantic city
Well i got a job and tried to
Put my money away,
But i got debts that no honest man can pay
So i drew what i had,
From the central trust,
And bought us two tickets on that city coast bus
[chorus]
Now our luck may have died,
And our love may be cold,
But with you forever, i'll stay
Now i been lookin' for a job, 
But it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers
Honey, last night, 
I met this guy, 
And i'm gonna do a favor for him.
Everything dies, baby that's a fact,
But maybe everything that dies
Someday, comes back
Put your hair up nice and sit up pretty, 
And meet me tonight in atlantic city
Meet me tonight in atlantic city
Meet me tonight in atlantic city
            
            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Way down in West Virginia,
There are some people who are one of a kind.
They don't need nothin' from nobody,
'Cause they're already doin' fine.
You got Hasil Adkins hunchin',
An' Mamie's raisin' hell.
The legend of D Ray White,
Will never die like a rebel yell.

An' ol' Jesco's dancin' in his daddy's shoes.
Yeah, ol' Hasil's still hunchin' out them Boone County blues.
(Boone County blues)
An' ol Mamie, you know she's done some time in jail.
The legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell.

-Instrumental break-

Birdie May White, she's the strongest woman,
That I've ever met in my life.
She raised over twenty-four of her own,
An' had to watch her husband dyin'.
She's always fightin' hard,
An' livin' off the land.
When she's done livin' in this world,
You know, the Lord's gonna take her by her hand.

An' ol' Jesco's dancin' in his Daddy's shoes.
Yeah, ol' Hasil's still hunchin' out them Boone County blues.
(Boone County blues.)
An' Mamie, you know she's still raisin' hell.
The legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell.
Yeah, the legend of D Ray White will never die like a rebel yell.

            Sittin up all night trying to have a good time singing my songs and trying to get paid
Ive been roughed up beat up Ive been cut I got a tattoo at a tender age
Never could respect a sheriff trying to break my neck with a few friends and a can of mace
Born on the south side with alot of rebel pride raised alot of hell in my younger days

Hey I cant help what I say
I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it
Well thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long
Its a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long

Running hard running free never gonna catch me driving too fast on a black top road
Loaded up hammered back I'll smack you with my tire jack you better walk away before I carry you home
Passing my pig sty sleeping where the dogs lie anywhere I go is where I call my home
Been stoned been straight been to hell and heavens gate I got thrown out when they said I didnt belong

Hey I just keep movin on
I could be right I could be wrong
It just might hurt but it makes me strong

If the shoe fits wear it
If the truth hurts bear it
Well thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long
Its a hard road to choose
Being good and paying dues
But thats the kind of life Im living and I plan on living long

            
            
            

            
            
                            
                        
         
            
                        


            
        
            





            
            Early one mornin' while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up the next morning and I grabbed my gun
took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow -
they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
Laid in the hot joint, takin' the pill
In walked the Sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said "Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown"
"You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"
Yes, oh yes my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
(Instrumental break)
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
I had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my doddered carcass in that county jail
The next morning 'bout a half past nine
I spied a Sheriff comin' down the line
He kind of coughed as he cleared his throat
He said "Come on you dirty hack, to the district court"
Entered the courtroom, and my trial began
where I was held by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that dirty judge commence to look about
(Instrumental break)
In about five minutes, in walked a man
holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read "In the first degree.."
I hollered "Lordy, Lordy - have mercy on me!"
The judge smiled as he picked up his pen
"Ninety-nine years in the Folsom State Pen"
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen up to me
"Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be!"
